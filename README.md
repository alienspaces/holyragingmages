## Overview

Source code for the game [Holy Raging Mages](https://holyragingmages.com).

You are a mage with:

* Three spells only
* Three items only
* A familliar (that is Mage talk for a pet)
* Strength, dexterity and intelligence (those are "stats")
* Money $$

You are in this situation where you have to keep fighting monsters and other mages to survive! It is terrible really..

You can:

* Learn new spells (they don't come free)
* Replace spells with other spells (because you can only have three)
* Collect or buy new items (collect off the dead or buy with your money $$)
* Replace items with other items (because you can only have three)
* Replace your familliar with another familliar (sometimes they die or are just not very good as a pet)
* Improve your strength, dexterity and intelligence (lets you learn cooler spells and use more powerful items)
* Get more money $$
* Fight monsters for average items and little money
* Fight other mages for better items and better money
* Decide how you want to fight (this is kind of important)

* Items can have limited doses or charges (potions and wands)
* Spells can have cool down timers (must wait a certain number of turns before you can use the spell again)

### Gameplay

Players do not control turn by turn what actions their mage or familliar do.

Instead a player will be able to determine how their mage and familliar fight by adjusting how offensive, defensive or regenerative their actions should be.

This setting can be adjusted for the mage and the familliar independently.

* When playing offensively spells and items categorised as offensive will be used more often
* When playing defensively spells and items categorised as defensive will be used more often
* When playing supportively spells and items categorised as supportive will be used more often
