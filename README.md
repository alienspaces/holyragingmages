# Holy Raging Mages

## Setup

You are a mage with:

* Five spells only
* Five items only
* A familliar (that is Mage talk for a pet)
* Strength, dexterity and intelligence (those are "stats")
* Money $$

You are in this situation where you have to keep fighting monsters and other mages to survive! It is terrible really..

You can:

* Learn new spells
* Replace spells with other spells (because you can only have five)
* Collect or buy new items (collect off the dead or buy with your money $$)
* Replace items with other items (because you can only have five)
* Replace your familliar with another familliar (sometimes they die or are just not very good as a pet)
* Improve your strength, dexterity and intelligence (lets you learn cooler spells and use more powerful items)
* Get more money $$
* Fight monsters for average items and little money
* Fight other mages for better items and better money
* Decide how you want to fight (this is kind of important)
